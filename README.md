This is an email client will be designed to maximize productivity.

Enhanced productivity is a result of eliminating the temptation to constantly check email. This is accomplished by making the login process more difficult and thus offering a moment to question whether it's really necessary to login in to check every five minutes.

This will reduce distractions to facilitate longer bouts of uninterrupted deep work.

A complementary program will serve to automatically check for and download any emails classified as important [determined by containing a keyword saved in a list of important keywords.]
  - This will require automatic sign ins which may be onerous to the security minded
  - Ways to mitigate the security concerns would be to make a separate program to encrypt and decrypt password info and then schedule its execution alongside the automatic checker with a program like cron. This would enable saving the encrypted password in a plaintext file along with the EmailClient itself.
